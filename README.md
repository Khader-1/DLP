Backup Policy

    Policy Statement:
        The purpose of this backup policy is to ensure the availability and integrity of critical data and systems within the organization. Regular backups will be performed to mitigate the risk of data loss and minimize downtime in the event of system failures.

    Backup Schedule:
        Full Backups: Full backups of all critical servers will be performed on a weekly basis, preferably during non-business hours.
        Incremental Backups: Incremental backups will be performed daily, capturing changes made since the last full backup.

    Retention Period:
        Full Backups: Full backups will be retained for a period of four weeks.
        Incremental Backups: Incremental backups will be retained for a period of two weeks.

    Backup Methodology:
        Active Directory: Regular backups of the Active Directory database and system state will be taken to ensure user and group information, security settings, and policies are preserved.
        DHCP: DHCP server configurations and lease information will be backed up to restore network connectivity settings efficiently.
        DNS: DNS zone files and configuration settings will be backed up to ensure domain name resolution functionality.
        File and Print Servers: Critical file shares and printer configurations will be backed up to restore important data and printing services.
        Web Application: The web application codebase and associated databases will be backed up to restore the website's functionality.
        Database: Regular backups of databases will be performed, ensuring data integrity and availability.
        Virtualization Environment: Virtual machine configurations and associated virtual disks will be backed up to restore the virtual environment if needed.

    Testing and Verification:
        Backup integrity and restoration processes will be periodically tested to ensure backups are valid and can be successfully restored.

    Offsite Storage:
        Backup data will be stored offsite in a secure location to protect against physical damage or loss at the primary site.

    Security and Access Control:
        Backup data will be encrypted during transit and storage to maintain data confidentiality. Access to backup systems and data will be restricted to authorized personnel only.

    Review and Update:
        This policy will be reviewed regularly to incorporate any changes in server infrastructure or business requirements, ensuring its effectiveness and relevance.
